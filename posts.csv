          I was playing Katarina today, I was killing minions and I threw my q at one that was almost dead but before my q could go off a minion killed the minion I was aiming at and my cooldown wasn&#039;t refunded. It&#039;s only happened once that but it did happen.

          So I have an idea for a support/control mage champion. Haven&#039;t really put a name to the champion but have come up with the abilities surrounding the idea. The concept I have is an electric/lightning champion that can engage or disengage a fight.

Passive- Walking around causes friction, after stacking to 100 *like Passive on Yasuo* causes the next basic attack to inflict 35 bonus magic damage (Scaling with Ability Power) and slow the enemy for 10% movement speed for 2 seconds.

Lightning Bolt/Q- Calls upon the skies to strike down on a designated area. After a 1.5 second delay, a bolt of lightning descends. Enemies standing around the center are dealt 70,95,120,145,170 damage (Scaling with Ability Power) and slowed by 35% decaying over 2 seconds. Enemies standing in the center are dealt 50% more damage and stunned for 1 second. Cooldowns per level: 13,12,11,10,9

Electric Fence/W- Summons a fence *like Acceleration Gate on Jayce*  for 5 seconds that any enemy champion who passes through are stunned for .5 seconds, and are dealt 50,65,80,95,110 damage (Scaling with Ability Power). Friendly champions who pass through the fence gain 35% movement speed decaying over 2 seconds and gain 20% attack speed decaying over 2 seconds. Cooldowns per level: 16,15,14,13,12

Power Up/E- Targets a friendly champion (Can be cast on yourself) and grants them 35% attack speed decaying over 2 seconds but also gives the friendly champion 3 empowered auto attacks that deal bonus magic damage *like E on Nami* (Scaling with Ability Power) that cause a chain of lightning to bounce up to 5 enemies *like R on Volibear* Cooldowns per level: 15,14,13,12,11

Thunderstorm/R- Begins to summon a storm cloud and after a 1.5 second delay, the designated area is covered by a cloud that summons lightning bolts that strike the ground below it and deal 110/150/190 damage per second *like R on Gangplank* (Scaling with Ability Power). Each enemy standing within the clouds radius is slowed by 25% for 2 seconds and have a chance of being stunned for .5 seconds (Can only occur once per champion) Cooldowns per level: 110,90,70

Let me know what you think of this idea for a new champion! Please look at my other champion ideas and leave comments there too! Will keep trying my best to come up with new and creative ideas. Thank you!

          I think (know*) the ban feature is waaaay overused and would like to hear what the community thinks about it.

my thoughts...
1) Take the report feature out of post game.

why? - people should have to go to a specific option in game or the players profile. anything that is easy to do will be done more than something that is harder to do. this is the main reason why i think it is an overused option. for example if i tell my top lane to stop feeding and play back and safe, he will 75% of the time not change at all and feed. thats his choice. i then say this is why we lose bc kids like you feed and wont help the team. he then gets butt hurt and reports me for toxic behavior bc its right there and all he has to do is click 2 times and i am punished. that to me is insane. on the other hand if you have to search the summoner name, then click report option, then select a few question, and type a short description, ppl wont do that unless they actually believe that the player needs to be punished. 

2) quit wearing your feelings on your shoulder...
3) its just a game dont let ppl get to you... its just as much a mental game as a skill based game
4) trolling should be a part of this game just like literally every other game on the planet.
5) this is, and im not kidding, the only game where i have ever even reported someone. and people are waaaaay worse on wow, cod, etc. this game just makes it too easy for butt hurt kids to report ppl for everything.

now if you disagree with me dont post anything or i will report you for for toxic behavior ;P

          Hey guys,

Last game I played a match where the enemy team had a twitch.

I saw him running towards our group while we were going back to base, i saw him using camouflage so i used a control ward right in the middle of our group to be able to see him.

Next thing you know, he pops out of camouflage right next to the control ward and we couldnt see him before.

Putting control wards in plain sight just to counter twitch is already a pain in the a** to do, so if it even doesnt work what can you do about it?

TIA for help!

          Hey guys. 

I was thinking off how we could rework Wukong. Sure he is decent right now, but he he is also outdated and could enjoy some fresh wind. 

First of all, how do we see Wukong and what are his Keyparts: 


- Stealth Engage: The ability to go into stealth and engage into the backline doing massive dmg surprising the enemy team. 
- Trickster: The ability to trick enemys with your clone and mobility. 
- Cyclone: His Ultimate is a big Keypart of Wukong and it would be nice if this could stay like it is. 

What can we cut out of his current Kit ? 

- His Q and the armorpen: It&#039;s nice to have it but it wouldnt be horrific if we would remove this ability since its not that meaningfull at all. 

- His Passive: His passive is one of the most forgotte passive in the game. Its &quot; ok &quot; to have it in the lategame but it could be reworked.

What are his strenghts what are his cons ? 

- Wukong is really punished when he falls behind. Since he has no form of waveclear or skillshot he can get punished for ever single minion he wants to take when behind. 

- Needs Dmg Items to be usefull. 

- His only direction is into the enemy. Trading against an enemy who is ahead is basicly never worth 

- He is mainly physical DMG. One Sunfire and he gets shit on. 

- Strong Initiation: His Init is A+ Lv. high DMG, good CC. 

- Very mobile: His is a really mobile Champion. 

- Snowballs really hard. 


What do we want ? 

- Keeping the Idendity of being a stealth engager with the Ultimate. 

- The ability to trick the enemy. 

- Adding some form of ranged skillshot.  

- Adding various DMG types ( such as AP or %Physical ). 

- Giving the enemy Time to react and counterplay. 

- Giving some way to improve his Jungling.

THE ABILITIES:
-

&gt; - Passive: No specific Name yet

&gt;After being unseen for at least 0.75 seconds, Wukong next basic attack or ability will slow his target for 20/25/30/35/40%. Also his next basic attack will deal 15+10/Lv. magic damage. 

This will improve he pre 6 Jungling a bit. The slow will scale for each point you put into W. This will prevent him from getting to much CC too early since you usually max W last. Also this will ad some magic damage into lane so he doesnt get fully punished when the enemy Maokai rushes Sunfire Cape. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; - Q: Crushing Blow  

&gt; Skillshot:  Wukong extends his Staff and smashing it into ground in a straight line in front of him dealing X physical damage ( + % current HP dmg, not sure about this ) to all enemy units. Also the first enemy champion he hits will be marked. 

Another big change. This ability will give Wukong a way to do smthing even when behind and provides him with decent waveclear. Imagine an Illaoi Q just way thinner and way faster. The mark will be interesting once you lvl&#039;d W and E ( dont worry they will remain the same ). This Q will allow you to harass your enemy but its slow enough for the enenmy to react. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; - W: Decoy  

&gt; Wukong enters invisibility for 1.5 seconds and leaves behind a decoy of himself which, after 1.5 seconds, vanishes and deals magic damage to all nearby enemies. If there is a marked enemy nearby the Clone will instead use a mimiced Nimbus Strike(E) on that enemy dealing half of Nimbus Strikes(E) damage. The Clone vanishes after he used Nimbus Strike(E). Wukong will remain stealth until it breaks. 

This combo can also trigger the passive slow ( but not the magic damage ). It also has cool mindplay in it. Remember it only jumps on the marked champion and thats the first hit with your Q. This can result into a nice combo in lane = hitting Q - W  and re(al)engage with your E + Passive. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; - E: Nimbus Strike

Remains how it is. The only change is that your clone can only use nimbus strike if you have lvl&#039;d it at least once. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; - R: Cyclone 

Also remains the same. The Movementspeed gain will probably be lowered to compensate the additional slow. 



Well thats it so far. This is a raw concept without big numbers. I tryed to keep Wukongs Idendity. 

I was playing around with an additional W passive like &quot; Wukong gains 20% Damage-Reduction for 1/2/3 seconds &quot; but  I think that would be too much tho . 

Pls send feedback and/or add some fresh Ideas.

          Ziggs passive occasionally grants his next auto attack some AP scaling, but the thing that has been bothering me, is the fact that it is one of the worst attack animations in the game. It is slow as hell with a long wind up. Other mages who have no ap scaling on there auto attacks have better animations.

I just think its kinda silly for him to have such a horrible attack when he actually needs to use it to get damage off. Other mages don&#039;t use there auto attacks so it doesn&#039;t matter if it is bad.

In Ziggs case, his auto attacks matters....Can he get a decent animation please?

          AND I&#039;M LOVING IT!

I&#039;m not sure what caused this considering I&#039;ve been B3-S5 for the past couple seasons however so far this preseason I have over a 90% win ratio so that&#039;s what I&#039;m attributing to this. Anyways, in several recent games I&#039;ve been getting matched up with gold and platinum elo players and though it&#039;s made things considerably tougher I&#039;m personally loving the challenge.

These players are actually punishing me hard for my mistakes which is in turn FORCING me to learn and adapt in real time just to avoid losing to them and the element of randomness in terms of teams throwing back and forth feels almost gone from these games. Because I literally have to try hard just to not die too it keeps me from going on auto pilot which has seen to it that I play better more consistently now too.

I wish I could get matched with higher elo players more often because this is what it takes for me to improve and get better at this game. I learn by being punished over and over again for every tiny little mistake that I make which other Bronze and Silver players just don&#039;t do for me. I&#039;ll be sad if it turns out that this is a bug though and that it&#039;ll get fixed because then my learning will slow down again... x.x

Anyone else experiencing this though and if so, what are your thoughts on it?

          I know Riot plans to release the changes in 6.24 and not this patch, but I&#039;m just wondering if you guys came up with another idea that you liked better, or if you&#039;re just holding off to tune the numbers

Somebody mentioned a &#039;new mechanic&#039; for Garen - presumably not armor shred? Are you guys willing to tell us what it is?

          So title pretty much says it all. I really like Braum as a character but I find that enjoy him a heck of a lot more after lane phase. And I figured Id ask what im doing wrong during lane phase. I pretty much just try and hit with q and jump shield my ally if it will help. But thats pretty much it. Is there something I should be doing differently please let me know ^^ bc I really want to get better at him hes a lot of fun.

          So I was rvising for exams when this champion idea came to me the main theme is a champion that can change autoatacks throu changing his weapon 
So for his Q i thout of a syth (since i think league need one on a champion) when he activate Q his weapon changes to a syth and his auto becaume melee and aoe and he get a passive for a duration after the activation giving him bonuses that fit to his syth like life steal or atack speed or every 3rd auto he striks in a circle around him also when activated he pulles enemy toward him abit  so he uses Q pull enemys and get a buff for a duration then he just auto normally
for W i thout of gunns I didn&#039;t think of the activation ability like the pull on his Q but it can be a skill shot in a line and gets a buff that fits his guns play style ofc he gets range
for E i thout of a weapon that looks like akalie&#039;s weapon abit but attached to a chain it has medum range (not as long as his gun form) when activated he lunches a skillshot in a line that stuns the first enemy hit and he get pulled to them put doesn&#039;t pull the enemy stun and when cast on a wall he can leap to it and if it&#039;s thin enauph he can leap behind the wall 
For ult i haven&#039;t thout of it well but it can boost all the efects of his abilities for a duration 
Also i haven&#039;t thout of a passive 
Auto attack damage is not the same at all form so you won&#039;t get to play only using one auto attack form for the rest of the game so maybe damage reduction on a form and damage buff on another one
But i layed like a theme or a base idea and i&#039;d like coments to complete what is missing or changes and make it fan made
Just few things i really want is the syth because i think it&#039;s a cool weapon (that is not used properlly by fiddelsticks xD) and beside using it to throw bananas i think it should be used to slash enemys in meele attacks and i&#039;d love white hair and red eyes *_*

          Hey all,

More often than not over the last few patches (not sure exactly when it started) when I go to level up an ability on a champ by clicking the arrow above the move (q,w,e), the arrow becomes slightly grayed out, but remains until the next time I level the ability again. This is pretty annoying when it seems like I&#039;ve forgotten to level something and can&#039;t click it, or if this bug takes places when ranking for the 5th time and is then permanently stuck for the rest of the game. To be honest I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s purely visual (and haven&#039;t even thought about it until just now) but doubt that my skills are actually not leveling. 

I&#039;ve never really reported a bug before and usually whatever I notice eventually becomes fixed in the next patch, but this time it&#039;s been a while and I haven&#039;t seen anyone else mention it. I&#039;d say by estimate it actually happens about 40% of the time but seems to be getting more frequent. Unfortunately I do not have any screenshots, nor would I know how exactly to provide one. So if there&#039;s any confusion on what exactly I am talking about just let me know and I&#039;ll see if I can explain it. 

Thanks!

          Topic may be a bit confusing, but what I mean is I cant open the client through the main way (On patcher and hitting launch) I can only open my client through the alpha client i installed when I was accepted. While I had the alpha i was able to open the old client and play it through the patcher, so its not like the files are messed up. Also, I personally hate on the new client how long it takes to look at a skins splash art from the store. When I look at the splash though, and when I went to buy the skin (Jayce Brighthammer) it didnt let me purchase. Finally, I dont know if this is only me, but when I get into champ select, or go into any page or anything on the new client that is like out of the default places (clicking on a champ in the store, champ select, etc.) this happens: (gyazo link)

          Can we change teemo&#039;s passive to:
If Teemo stands still for 1 second he becomes invisable. Upon coming out of stealth his first auto attacks amplifies all DoT damage on the target by X amount as long as Teemo remains in combat with the target.

And change his shrooms so they can no longer be disabled or destroyed but made visable by sweepers and control wards. 

These would allow him to be more easily balanced and not force him to build like a bruiser to be effective

This happens every time I go to record a play using the new replay feature. It just happening all the time. It&#039;s worth noting the replay itself is fine, its just the webm that is recorded via the replay clients record button.

Steps for reproduction:
1. Download a replay
2. Watch replay
3. Record the replay via the in client record button (ctrl+v)
4. Listen to the replay.

I feel like this is an issue on my end (or at lesat with my machine?)

Let me know if there is anything else I can try to help fix this!

          {{item:3071}} gives a shit ton of HP, damage, **20% CDR**, a speed boost, and potentially AOE armor reduction that also benefits teammates. All for a strong build path and relatively low cost.

Compare the cost to other core damage items such as {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3078}} 

How is this allowed?

          So, supports just don&#039;t get gold, we all know that. A big part of it is that they have to buy a support item AND sightstone, or combine them, but sacrifice active item effects. Why not give sightstone increased gold per second based upon map coverage across the team? It would be a neutral power spike for pro play, and would give more incentive for layers to ward in lower elo games. Also, supports are boring to many people because they aren&#039;t super flashy. Of anyone remembers when thresh was released, support was one of the more popular roles back then because he brought just so much playmaking potential to the role. I know that many people picked up the role when he was released, and bard is the only other champion I can think of who revolutionized the role as much as thresh. 
Lastly, if more lanes were opened up to support, as was done with ivern(though he has not revolutionized the role much yet), more people would play them. Imagine a support who could legitimately go top lane, while there is a bruiser bot who can legitimately fulfill his role. Champions don&#039;t have to be released in an op state anymore, and if a champion is severely underplayed on release, support them by making other champions work well with them.

          Hybrid pen and AR pen runes existed to be strong early game stats. Since they were nerfed, let us refund them. I will never use Hybrid pen runes again, especially since Akali scales better with AD now and buffs have negative armor making hybrid pen runes even less appealing on Elise. 

They were already ridiculously overpriced to begin with. It&#039;s unfair to have us waste ~10,000 IP on 2 sets of useless runes.
